### PROJECT: SELF-PORTRAIT

---

_Please note that this project is optional. Choose this project or the [Song Intonation](projects_song_intonation.md) project. Do not do both._

**Self-Portrait** 5 seconds

* Make a five second motion graphics piece about yourself. What you like, what you do, what you know, what you LOVE. Anything really. Just make it personal.

Specifications:
* Type can be point, outlined, plane, or hand-drawn 
    * Motion Design 032-033 (also pinned on slack)
* Support imagery such as lines, shapes, and fragmented letterforms are
encouraged 
    * reference Moving Type 40-41 or Motion Design 038-039
* Audio is required.

**Self-Portrait Redux** 5 seconds

* You will reiterate a classmates’ self portrait, NOT YOUR OWN, by exchanging after effects files and assets. You can NOT start completely from scratch. You must incorporate at least one element from the original piece. You do not have to use them all however. Think of remixes of music. Some remixes retain the quality of the original, while others are totally unrecognizable from the original. You want to communicate your first impression of your classmate or your own interpretation of a portrait of them.
