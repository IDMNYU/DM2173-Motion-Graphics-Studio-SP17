### ASSIGNMENT: AETUTS Homework
 ---

Make sure you know how to use the following techniques. Concentrate on the techniques that you have not used yet. However, it's super quick to go through all of them (the ones I do not list below) to review things you might already know.

I feel strongly that AETUTS is the simplest, most direct, and quickest way to understand these concepts. If the AETUTS tutorials do not help, seek out another tutorial (lynda or otherwise).
