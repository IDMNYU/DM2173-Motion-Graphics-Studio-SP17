### SUCCESS CHECKLIST

---

* **HAVE A GOAL AND KEEP IT REALISTIC**
A well thought out and well executed 10 seconds is infinitely better than a mediocre 5 minutes. Motion graphics is about using time, space and design to maximize your ability to communicate the objective. Longer does not necessarily equal better. Complex does not necessarily equal more effective. 
* **STRIVE TO DO YOUR ABSOLUTE BEST**
Remember FINISHED NOT PERFECT. Besides, perfection is subjective and never obtainable anyway, while attention to detail (i.e. spelling!), ability to convey your objective to your audience, meeting deadlines, and completing the project to requirements ARE NOT subjective. 
* **LEARN HOW TO LEARN**
No one will teach you better than you can teach yourself. Technology moves at a very fast pace and what you know today may not, and chances are will not, be enough tomorrow. Learn to not only “how to learn” but also how to seek out what is out there that may be worth learning - ie: new software, plugins, techniques, inspirations. 
* **USE YOUR RESOURCES** 
The Internet is the quickest access to information you have, but don’t forget that books and magazines offer a wealth of info and inspiration. Also, study and do your projects outside of class together. 
* **GET OUT OF YOUR OWN HEAD** 
If you do not constantly look at the work of others, you will never grow as a designer as you'll only regurgitate what you are currently capable of. Continuous improvement, not perfection, is the goal. 
* **RESEARCH AND DEVELOP YOUR IDEA** 
Do that before diving in head first into the project! Consider all of the following questions before you settle on a direction:
* What is your objective? Who is your intended audience?
* Are there cultural/social/historical/creative context you need to be aware of?
* Why should anyone care about what you have to say?
* How can you convince them of this visually?
* Is your aesthetic direction conducive to communicating your idea? Or are your design choices taking away from the concept? How will your initial concepts of use of time/space, composition, color, use of shapes/images/type/audio will contribute to the overall project? Why are you making the visual choices you are making? 
* **CONSIDER ALL ASPECTS OF THE DESIGN** 
Color, composition, typography, pacing, rhythm, contrast, tension etc. Try to keep in mind the total vision and how each component affects it, at all times! 
* **GIVE CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK DURING CRITIQUES**
Your feedback is vital to the growth of your classmates as well as your OWN creative
development. 
* **BE OPEN TO CRITIQUES OF YOUR WORK AND CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM**
Check your ego at the door! You will never get better if you are unable to deal with your own mistakes, shortcomings and weak spots. 
* **ALWAYS REMEMBER: THERE IS ALWAYS MORE THAN ONE WAY TO DO SOMETHING.**
