### MGS Pre-Work

---
**Your Commitment to this Course**
* If you are prone to saying that "this course is too much work," this course may not be for you. This course will require a LOT of time outside of class AT LEAST 8 to 16 hours every week. You will be able to build some amazing portfolio pieces in this course, but only if you are committed to doing so. This is not a class where you can do the homework the night before. It's actually not physically possible. If this is your mode of operating, I wouldn't recommend this course for you. There are 18 people on the waitlist so if you are not totally committed to this course I'd recommend that you drop the course and find another by consulting with Eric. I only want students who really want to create amazing work and will push themselves to do so.

**First Day of Class**
* **Thursday, Jan 26** (instead of Tues Jan 24. I will be attending a conference out of town.)

**Slack Invite (http://bxmc.slack.com)**
* You will be receiving an invitation from Slack shortly. Please accept it. I have to manually enter you to the mgs slack channel. Please be patient.
* If you've been in one of my classes before, you'll automatically be added with the username and password you used before with my class.
* I suggest changing your [slack account notification settings](https://bxmc.slack.com/account/notifications) to receive slack notifications via your nyu email so you don't miss any posts.

**Adobe After Effects**
* If you don't already have the following software, purchase the student adobe creative cloud option to get Adobe After Effects.

**Lynda http://nyu.edu/lynda (sign in with your nyu account to get these tutorials for free)**
* Begin the Lynda after effect tutorials IMMEDIATELY before the semester begins so that you can absorb the material and not be distracted by your other classes. After Effects has a steep learning curve for some so I wouldn't wait to begin these tutorials.

Do one or both of these tutorials first
* **After Effects CC 2017 Essential Training: The Basics** by Mark Christiansen OR
* **After Effects Apprentice 01: CC Pre-Roll** by Chris Meyer OR
* **Both** tutorials to get two different voices and approaches

Do the essential training or apprentice series or both second
* **After Effects CC Essential Training (2015)** by Ian Robinson OR
* **After Effects Apprentice** 01-14 (multiple courses) by Chris Meyer or Trish Meyer OR
* **Both** Series to get different voices and approaches

**After Effects Diary**
* Begin entering entries for the [After Effects Diary](https://deangela.gitbooks.io/motion-graphics-studio-spring-2017/content/after_effects_diary.html).

**Required Book**
* Purchase **Moving Type: Designing for Time and Space** by Matt Woolman & Jeff Bellantoni OR **Motion Design** by Matt Woolman. Both are out of print, but purchase whichever is cheaper on amazon.com or half.com. Do not buy both. There are many on Amazon that will be anywhere from $4 to $21 including shipping.
    * [Amazon: Moving Type](https://www.amazon.com/Moving-Type-Designing-Time-Space/dp/2880463696/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1484081727&sr=8-1&keywords=moving+type) 
    * [Half.com: Moving Type](http://product.half.ebay.com/Type-in-Motion-Innovations-in-Digital-Graphics-by-Matt-Woolman-and-Jeff-Bellantoni-1999-Hardcover/1127478&tg=info)
For whatever reason, Motion Design is always more expensive than Moving Type but they are essentially the same book. So again whichever you can find cheaper and do not buy both.

**Show and Tell**
* After quickly researching [the choices](https://deangela.gitbooks.io/motion-graphics-studio-spring-2017/content/show_and_tells.html), please post on the class main slack channel, mgs_sp17, your show and tell choice. First come first serve.

**Syllabus**
* You can find the syllabus online at gitbook and pinned on slack.
* Please read carefully before class.
* Let me know if you find any broken links or typos.
