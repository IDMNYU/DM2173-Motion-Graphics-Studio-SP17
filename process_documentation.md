### PROCESS DOCUMENTATION
Your process, the steps you take to visually and aurally conceptualize your final project, needs to be documented for evaluation. The documentation sketchbook that contains any materials, including sketches, inspirational findings, etc.

### THE DESIGN PROCESS
Each assignment in this course will present a challenging encounter with creative problem solving. To successfully complete each assignment, you will need to learn how to negotiate the subtle relationships between content and form: content being what you want to say, and form how you choose to say it. The two are brought together cohesively through the design process, steps taken before arriving at a finished design solution. 

The design process consists of three phases: research, design, & build. However, before you can begin the design process you must define the problem and establish your goal.

####DEFINE THE PROBLEM AND ESTABLISH YOUR GOAL 
Once given the assignment, you need to define your objectives. Carefully consider the following questions: What is the desired result or goal of the project? What is the message? Who is it for?
What format can best express the message?

**Research**
* Do the Research. 
It is impossible to solve a problem you don’t understand! Learn about the subject at hand. Look for parallels in other fields, subjects, time periods, and industries. The more information you collect from multiple sources, the more associations you can make between them. 
* Develop Your Ideas by Brainstorming. 
Brainstorming is an idea-generating process based on free association that uses a written
record of verbalized ideas. 
    * Start by making word lists of everything that relates to your subject. These lists can help you explore the trail of thoughts influenced by your research.
    * Another effective brainstorming method is verbal diagramming or **thought mapping**. Place a key word in the middle of a piece of paper and branch out in all directions as you write down other ideas that are related to the initial word. This approach lets you picture the structure of your thinking.

**Motion Design Workflow**

* **Mood Boards**
Either digital or traditional collection of images (or audio) which explore the desired aesthetic. These can be literal or abstract, they can represent color palettes, shapes, ideas, concepts, etc. They can be anything, analog or digital, or a combination of both.

* **Concept Description / Written Brief**
A written description of the concept. This should include your sources of inspiration, any creative reasoning behind your proposal, description of the connections between your visuals and your audio, a concise, clear description of how you intend to solve the visual problem presented by the project, any design notes, etc. Remember that this is a part of your “pitch” - use this to convince your audience that your design decisions are intentional and will effectively communicate the idea. 

* **Storyboards**

Text-Based and/or Image-Based sequence outlining the basic flow of your final piece, resolving general placement of elements, composition and camera angles if applicable. !

* **Style Frames**
Develop the storyboard into comps aka style frames: very detailed, polished representations of finished designs before embarking on final production, of 3 to 5 main key frames. Present multiple solutions during the comping stage, so that the strongest ideas can surface. 

* **Animatics**
Image-Based storyboard in motion with soundtrack. 

* **Motion Tests**
Sample animations developing key movements/effects/creative ideas to finalize a technique
and direction. 

* **Reviews**
* Critiques are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback.
* During the crit, the class analyzes and suggests ways to increase the visual and conceptual impact of each existing idea. 
* Take notes when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not.
* Review your crit notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand the comps that show the most promise. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and the project. 

**Build**
Inexperienced design students often want to rush through the above steps—often jumping
directly onto the computer. They do so at the expense of exploring creative possibilities. Care and attention to detail throughout each step of the design process is essential. If any steps are neglected, the final result will be lacking. Good design is developed through investigation, experimentation, creativity, hard work and a genuine curiosity on the part of the design student.

###ITERATE
Iteration is key throughout the entire design process:
From Merriam-Webster dictionary
* it•er•ate: to say or do again or again and again : REITERATE
* re•it•er•ate: to state or do over again or repeatedly sometimes with wearying effect
* it·er·a·tion: the action or a process of iterating or repeating: as
    * a procedure in which repetition of a sequence of operations yields results successively closer to a desired result
    * the repetition of a sequence of computer instructions a specified number of times or until a condition is met -- compare RECURSION
