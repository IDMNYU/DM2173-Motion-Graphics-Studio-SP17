**Retro**	5 seconds	
* Pick a decade – or a specific year. 
* Research your decade. If you decide to adventure way back in time (pre-animation!) think about the quality of movement that this decade would dictate.
* Use a wide variety of assets AND techniques and composite a piece which explores the design aesthetic of the era. This includes not just design elements, but your choice of images/video and effects. Your piece can have a historic storytelling aspect (1969, Apollo landing on the Moon!) which can drive the imagery, or you can be more abstract. Your piece MUST include typography!
* FOCUS ON: Design aesthetic, your choices of fonts and colors.
