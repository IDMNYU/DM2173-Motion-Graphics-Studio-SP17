## Welcome to Motion Graphics Studio!

Motion graphics can be found in a wide range of media: broadcast, web, animation, and film to name a few. This course will allow students to explore the elements of time and space to convey messages and meaning through type, image, and sound for the screen. Individual creativity will be stressed as well as the understanding and use of industry-standard software for developing motion graphics.

### PROGRAM GOALS

The following Integrated Digital Media program goals are introduced and reinforced within this course. Students will:

* develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
* develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.
* develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historical, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
* develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

### COURSE GOALS

* An introduction to designing for time and space including animation, special effects, and compositing
* Increased competency in visual communication problem solving through research, practice, and evaluation
* An increased understanding of the iterative process
* An Introduction to Adobe After Effects
* Increased competency in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop

### LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of the course, students will be able to create motion graphics for a wide range of media: broadcast, web, animation, film, etc.

### CLASS FORMAT

The class will consist of lectures, screenings, show & tells, demos, and critiques. 

Critiques are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. During the crit, the professor and your classmates analyze and suggest ways to increase the visual and conceptual impact of each existing idea. Take notes when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. Review your crit notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand the ideas that show the most promise. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project.

### TECHNOLOGY

This class is about motion graphics and visual concepts first and foremost & technology second. Through lectures, video tutorials, & demos, we will cover many important technical issues, but—as in the professional world—the burden of technology will always lie squarely on the designer’s shoulders. Community tech sharing is highly advised as well. Use your resources!

### STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES

* Come to class on time and participate actively in discussions (be present and engaged)
* Study outside of class (ideally with classmate(s))
* Schedule your time (keep a calendar of some sort)
* Devote **at least 8 to 16 hours** per week outside of class, fulfilling homework assignments, reading, and studying concepts covered in class.
* Consult slack at least once a week for up to date info
* Complete all assignments by due dates
* Acquire and read all assigned readings before they are due
* Submit a portfolio of work spanning the duration of class.
* Action – do your absolute best
* Strive for continuous improvement
* Direct message me on slack re: contact about logistics (when, where, how many?) only
* Talk to me in person about issues and problems. Do not direct message me long conversations on slack. (if your email turns into a paragraph or two that means you should be talking to me in person, not emailing me.)
* Have desire amounting to enthusiasm (to learn, to explore)
* Have patience, persistence, and discipline
* Be creative
* Pay attention to detail & craft
* Have self-confidence and pride in your work
* Take risks & be fearless in your projects
* Have fun!

### EVALUATION & GRADING

**Grading**

All work assigned will be complete and delivered on the due date, PRIOR TO CLASS TIME, otherwise you will receive a failing grade for the homework assignment. However, the assignment will still need to be completed for the end of the semester portfolio. Otherwise, you will be penalized twice for a missed assignment.

Evaluations will be conducted in the form of individual and class critiques. Class critiques will occur on a weekly basis.

Makeup assignments are only available when discussed with and approved by the instructor in advance of the original due date.

If you turn in your midterm or final before the due date, knowing that you will be absent on the midterm or final, 40 points will be subtracted from your final project grade. If you attend the midterm or final without a finished project, you will receive up to 40 points for your presence and participation. A late midterm or final (after 2:40pm on the due date) will not be accepted under any circumstances.

Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative & qualitative rubrics:

### Quantitative Overview

Your grade for the course will be based on the following:

* 56% Projects (14 projects x 4% each)
* 14% End of semester deliverables
* 10% Final Project
* 10% After Effects Diary
* 05% Show & Tell / Reverse Storyboard
* 05% Midterm and Final Self-Assessment

The final project grade will be based on the following:

* 40% Crit Presence And Participation
* 15% Concept/Meaning/Emotion/Theme
* 15% Space (Composition)
* 20% Time (Motion / Transitions)
* 05% Image (Visuals)
* 05% Type
* 05% Audio (Sound)

### Qualitative Overview

Each student will be judged on the quality, experimentation, and improvement that their work shows.

* **Excellent** Performance and attendance of the student has been of the highest level. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work. It has memorable impact and repeat playability. Work surpasses all of the criteria set forth in the assignment descriptions, and shows what is done by a highly self-motivated student who pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The content is exceptional with outstanding critical thinking,&original, thoughtful and/or imaginative ideas. Shows deft utilization of the fundamental, motion graphics principles of time, space, image, type, audio, and impeccable craft. Spelling, punctuation or grammar errors are nonexistent. It demonstrates a strong utilization of the ability to work independently, research / investigate, experiment / explore, and iterate.

* **Very Good / Good** Performance and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work is better than average, showing sensitivity to motion graphics and general design principles and extra effort. Work has very good/good levels of impact, conceptual development, and visual interest. Employs an understanding & utilization of process & iteration, and above average craft & attention to detail.

* **Satisfactory** Performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of motion graphics and general design principles. Work has acceptable levels of impact, conceptual development, and visual interest. It lacks thoughtful, original, and imaginative resolution and/or attention to detail and craft. It employs process and iteration but does not demonstrate notable solutions.

* **Poor / Below Average** Performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of motion graphics and general design principles. The impact of the work is weak with unsound, unoriginal, or unimaginative thinking. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning, poor production, and/or poor craft.

* **Unacceptable** Performance and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the motion graphics and general design principles on many levels, and/or a severe lack of interest.

**Attendance**

* Attendance is mandatory and will be taken at the beginning of every class. Since there is so much technical, conceptual, and design information to absorb, regular attendance is essential.
* Unexcused absences will affect your grade. One absence is allowed; after that, your final, overall, numerical grade will drop by 5 percent (1/2 a grade point (e.g. A to an A-)) for each additional absence.
* Be on Time. Tardiness will affect your grade. For every 15 minutes of tardiness, your final, numerical grade will drop by 0.625 percent
* Contact the professor IN ADVANCE if you will not be in class (in person or by slack is preferred).
* ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY DURING THE MIDTERM AND FINAL CRITIQUES.

### ACADEMIC & CREATIVE HONESTY

All  work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA style for citing and documenting source material.

### RIGHTS OF USE
You MUST have complete rights of use to any and all materials which appear in your final projects, with the exception of the audio for the film conversation project. This includes images, illustrations, audio etc. The source of any materials NOT created by you MUST be documented and credited. Please remember that you can collaborate with music students for audio tracks, create your own audio or contact the authors of your audio selections for rights. I strongly encourage you to use original images for all of your projects, however, should you absolutely require to use stock images/video etc., you will need to provide a PDF of all source files and the usage rights you have purchased/negotiated.

### THE DESIGN PROCESS
Each assignment in this course will present a challenging encounter with creative problem
solving. To successfully complete each assignment, you will need to learn how to negotiate the subtle relationships between content and form: content being what you want to say, and form how you choose to say it. The two are brought together cohesively through the design process, steps taken before arriving at a finished design solution. The design process consists of three
phases: research, design, & build. 

DEFINE THE PROBLEM AND ESTABLISH YOUR GOAL !
Once given the assignment, you need to define your objectives. Carefully consider the following questions: What is the desired result or goal of the project? What is the message? Who is it for?
What format can best express the message?

**Research**
* Do the Research. 
It is impossible to solve a problem you don’t understand! Learn about the subject at hand. Look for parallels in other fields, subjects, time periods, and industries. The more information you collect from multiple sources, the more associations you can make between them. 
* Develop Your Ideas by Brainstorming. 
Brainstorming is an idea-generating process based on free association that uses a written
record of verbalized ideas. Start by making word lists of everything that relates to your subject.
These lists can help you explore the trail of thoughts influenced by your research.
Another effective brainstorming method is verbal diagramming or “thought mapping.” Place a key word in the middle of a piece of paper and branch out in all directions as you write down other ideas that are related to the initial word. This approach lets you picture the structure of your thinking.

**Motion Design Workflow**

* **Mood Boards**
Either digital or traditional collection of images which explore the desired aesthetic. These can be literal or abstract, they can represent color palettes, shapes, ideas, concepts, etc. They can be anything, analog or digital, or a combination of both.

* **Concept Description / Written Brief**
A written description of the concept. This should include your sources of inspiration, any creative reasoning behind your proposal, description of the connections between your visuals and your audio, a concise, clear description of how you intend to solve the visual problem presented by the project, any design notes, etc. Remember that this is a part of your “pitch” - use this to convince your audience that your design decisions are intentional and will effectively
communicate the idea. 

* **Storyboards**

Text-Based and/or Image-Based sequence outlining the basic flow of your final piece, resolving general placement of elements, composition and camera angles if applicable. !

* **Style Frames**
Develop the storyboard into comps aka style frames: very detailed, polished representations of finished designs before embarking on final production, of 3 to 5 main key frames. Present multiple solutions during the comping stage, so that the strongest ideas can surface. 

* **Animatics**
Image-Based storyboard in motion with soundtrack. 

* **Motion Tests**
Sample animations developing key movements/effects/creative ideas to finalize a technique
and direction. 

* **Reviews**
* Critiques are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback.
* During the crit, the class analyzes and suggests ways to increase the visual and conceptual impact of each existing idea. 
* Take notes when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not.
* Review your crit notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand the comps that show the most promise. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and the project. 

**Build**
Inexperienced design students often want to rush through the above steps—often jumping
directly onto the computer. They do so at the expense of exploring creative possibilities. Care and attention to detail throughout each step of the design process is essential. If any steps are neglected, the final result will be lacking. Good design is developed through investigation, experimentation, creativity, hard work and a genuine curiosity on the part of the design student.

###ITERATE
Iteration is key throughout the entire design process:
From Merriam-Webster dictionary
* it•er•ate: to say or do again or again and again : REITERATE
* re•it•er•ate: to state or do over again or repeatedly sometimes with wearying effect
* it·er·a·tion: the action or a process of iterating or repeating: as
    * a procedure in which repetition of a sequence of operations yields results successively closer to a desired result
    * the repetition of a sequence of computer instructions a specified number of times or until a condition is met -- compare RECURSION

### ADVICE FOR SUCCESS
* HAVE A GOAL AND KEEP IT REALISTIC<br> 
A well thought out and well executed 30 seconds is infinitely better than a mediocre 5 minutes. Motion graphics is about using time, space and design to maximize your ability to communicate the objective. Longer does not necessarily equal better. Complex does not necessarily equal more effective. 
* STRIVE TO DO YOUR ABSOLUTE BEST<br>
BUT remember that perfection is subjective, while attention to detail (ie. spelling!), ability to convey your objective to your general audience, meeting deadlines and completing the project to requirements ARE NOT subjective. 
* LEARN HOW TO LEARN<br>
No one will teach you better than you can teach yourself. Technology moves at a very fast pace and what you know today may not, and chances are will not, be enough tomorrow. Learn to not only “how to learn” but also how to seek out what is out there that may be worth learning - ie: new software, plugins, techniques, inspirations. 
* USE YOUR RESOURCES 
The Internet is the quickest access to information you have, but don’t forget that books and magazines offer a wealth of info and inspiration. 
* GET OUT OF YOUR OWN HEAD 
What is important to you may not necessarily resonate with the rest of the world. The way you communicate may not necessarily be understood by a wide audience. Design is about
communicating ideas - keep your audience in mind! If your concept is of universal appeal,
remember to communicate it clearly. If your concept is not of universal appeal, remember that you will need to convince your audience WHY they should give your work their time. “Doing it for yourself” is great - but it is NOT what this course is about! 
* RESEARCH AND DEVELOP YOUR IDEA<br> 
Do that before diving in head first into the project! Consider all of the following questions before you settle on a direction:
* What is your objective? Who is your intended audience?
* Are there cultural/social/historical/creative context you need to be aware of?
* Why should anyone care about what you have to say?
* How can you convince them of this visually?
* Is your aesthetic direction conducive to communicating your idea? Or are your design choices taking away from the concept? How will your initial concepts of use of time/space, composition, color, use of shapes/images/type/audio will contribute to the overall project? Why are you making the visual choices you are making? 
* CONSIDER ALL ASPECTS OF THE DESIGN 
Color, composition, typography, pacing, rhythm, contrast, tension etc. Try to keep in mind the total vision and how each component affects it, at all times! 
* GIVE CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK DURING CRITIQUES
Your feedback is vital to the growth of your classmates as well as your OWN creative
development. 
* BE OPEN TO CRITIQUES OF YOUR WORK AND CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM 
Check your ego at the door! You will never get better if you are unable to deal with your own mistakes, shortcomings and weak spots. 
* ALWAYS REMEMBER: THERE IS ALWAYS MORE THAN ONE WAY TO DO SOMETHING.

### PROJECT GUIDELINES
* For all of your video work, always export a hi-res and lo-res version. 
    * Your hi-res versions will be turned in at the end of the semester. **DO NOT wait until the end of the semester to render these. Do it every week!**
    * Each week when your homework is due, your lo-res versions should be
uploaded to your Vimeo account. Make sure you ALWAYS use these three tags: **MGS, IDM, NYU**

All projects should be arranged as follows: 
* The root folder should be the PROJECT NAME. Inside your root folder:
* AEP (for all AfterEffects projects, please increment your projects as you save!)
* SOURCE (for all of your source files, you may organize your own structure within depending on
the needs of your project)(after effects, illustrator, photoshop, etc). Make sure that any type in
illustrator has been converted to outlines
* DESIGN (for all of your storyboards and style frame comps)
* DRAFTS (for all elements submitted for critiques)
* FINAL 
I will not require any further specific breakdowns. It will be up to you how to organize your project files efficiently. Do keep in mind that I WILL see your project folders as part of the final deliverables and you will be graded on your professionalism - part of which is your ability to efficiently & neatly organize & maintain your assets.


### FILE NAMING
(format dates as MonthDay: MMDDYY)

All PDFs should be labeled as follows: 
* FirstnameLastname_assignmentName_date.pdf 

All movies should be labeled as follows: 
* FirstnameLastname_assignmentName_date.mov 

All REVISED movies AND WRITTEN DOCS should be labeled as follows: 
* FirstnameLastname_assignmentName_REV1_date.mov (OR .pdf)
* Follow the pattern for iterations of revisions, REV2, REV3, etc.) 


### WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS
Any printed assignments should always contain the following and uploaded to the MGS Slack Channel or Direct Message to Professor. **Make sure your name is in the actual file name of the pdf** (see above):
* Date
* Your first and last name
* Motion Graphics Studio or MGS
* Spring 2017
* Title of project or assignment

Written assignments will be assigned frequently. These will typically involve writing about your work, learning how to use motion graphics terminology correctly and efficiently to describe your ideas. Be prepared to share your writing in class, as well as hand in your work via email, as a PDF document attachment, PRIOR to the start of the class at which it is due. 

Your writing should be clear, concise, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. Entries should question or discuss the assigned reading by using supporting research and/or examples to reinforce your argument or thesis. Possible examples could be from current media, events, class discussions, your classmates’ logs, and your own personal experience. Entries are graded using
the following criteria: level of insight and reflection, support provided for the observations and conclusions, the extent to which relevant course content (from class and the text) is integrated into the entries. 

Written assignments must be submitted no later than 1 week past due to be considered towards the final grade. Unless you are absent with prior notice on the date the written assignment is due, 20% of the grade for each assignment will be automatically deducted.
