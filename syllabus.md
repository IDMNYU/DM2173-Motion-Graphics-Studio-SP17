## Welcome to Motion Graphics Studio!

Motion graphics can be found in a wide range of media: broadcast, web, animation, and film to name a few. This course will allow students to explore the elements of time and space to convey messages and meaning through type, image, and sound for the screen. Individual creativity will be stressed as well as the understanding and use of industry-standard software for developing motion graphics.

### PROGRAM GOALS

The following Integrated Digital Media program goals are introduced and reinforced within this course. Students will:

* develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
* develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.
* develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historical, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
* develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

### COURSE GOALS

* An introduction to designing for time and space including animation, special effects, and compositing
* Increased competency in visual communication problem solving through research, practice, and evaluation
* An increased understanding of the iterative process
* An Introduction to Adobe After Effects
* Increased competency in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop

### LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of the course, students will be able to create motion graphics for a wide range of media: broadcast and cable tv, web, animation, and film to name a few.

### CLASS FORMAT

The class will consist of lectures, screenings, show & tells, demos, and critiques. Both collaborative and individual projects will be given.

Critiques are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. During the crit, the professor and your classmates analyze and suggest ways to increase the visual and conceptual impact of each existing idea. Take notes when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. Review your crit notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand the ideas that show the most promise. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project.

### TECHNOLOGY

This class is about motion graphics and visual concepts first and foremost & technology second. Through lectures, video tutorials, & demos, we will cover many important technical issues, but—as in the professional world—the burden of technology will always lie squarely on the designer’s

shoulders. Community tech sharing is highly advised as well. Use your resources!

### STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES

* Come to class on time and participate actively in discussions \(be present and engaged\)
* Study outside of class \(ideally with classmate\(s\)\)
* Schedule your time \(keep a calendar of some sort\)
* Devote at a minimum 4 to 8 hours per week outside of class, fulfilling homework assignments, reading, and studying concepts covered in class.
* Consult slack at least once a week for up to date info
* Complete all assignments by due dates
* Acquire and read all assigned readings before they are due
* Submit a portfolio of work spanning the duration of class.
* Action – do your absolute best
* Strive for continuous improvement
* Direct message me on slack re: contact about logistics \(when, where, how many?\) only
* Talk to me in person about issues and problems. Do not direct message me long conversations on slack. \(if your email turns into a paragraph or two that means you should be talking to me in person, not emailing me.\)
* Have desire amounting to enthusiasm \(to learn, to explore\)
* Have patience, persistence, and discipline
* Be creative
* Pay attention to detail & craft
* Have self-confidence and pride in your work
* Take risks & be fearless in your projects
* Have fun!

### EVALUATION & GRADING

**Grading**

All work assigned will be complete and delivered on the due date, PRIOR TO CLASS TIME, otherwise you will receive a failing grade for the homework assignment. However, the assignment will still need to be completed for the end of the semester portfolio. Otherwise, you will be penalized twice for a missed assignment.

Evaluations will be conducted in the form of individual and class critiques. Class critiques will occur on a weekly basis.

Makeup assignments are only available when discussed with and approved by the instructor in advance of the original due date.

If you turn in your midterm or final before the due date, knowing that you will be absent on the midterm or final, 40 points will be subtracted from your final project grade. If you attend the midterm or final without a finished project, you will receive up to 40 points for your presence and participation. A late midterm or final \(after 2:40pm on the due date\) will not be accepted under any circumstances.

Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative & qualitative rubrics:

### Quantitative Overview

Your grade for the course will be based on the following:

* 56% Projects \(14 projects x 4% each\)
* 14% End of semester deliverables
* 10% Final Project
* 10% After Effects Diary
* 05% Show & Tell / Reverse Storyboard
* 05% Midterm and Final Self-Assessment

The final project grade will be based on the following:

* 40% Crit Presence And Participation
* 15% Concept/Meaning/Emotion/Theme
* 15% Space \(Composition\)
* 20% Time \(Motion / Transitions\)
* 05% Image \(Visuals\)
* 05% Type
* 05% Audio \(Sound\)

### Qualitative Overview

Each student will be judged on the quality, experimentation, and improvement that their work shows.

* **Excellent** Performance and attendance of the student has been of the highest level. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work. It has memorable impact and repeat playability. Work surpasses all of the criteria set forth in the assignment descriptions, and shows what is done by a highly self-motivated student who pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The content is exceptional with outstanding critical thinking,&original, thoughtful and/or imaginative ideas. Shows deft utilization of the fundamental, motion graphics principles of time, space, image, type, audio, and impeccable craft. Spelling, punctuation or grammar errors are nonexistent. It demonstrates a strong utilization of the ability to work independently, research / investigate, experiment / explore, and iterate.

* **Very Good / Good** Performance and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work is better than average, showing sensitivity to motion graphics and general design principles and extra effort. Work has very good/good levels of impact, conceptual development, and visual interest. Employs an understanding & utilization of process & iteration, and above average craft & attention to detail.

* **Satisfactory** Performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of motion graphics and general design principles. Work has acceptable levels of impact, conceptual development, and visual interest. It lacks thoughtful, original, and imaginative resolution and/or attention to detail and craft. It employs process and iteration but does not demonstrate notable solutions.

* **Poor / Below Average** Performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of motion graphics and general design principles. The impact of the work is weak with unsound, unoriginal, or unimaginative thinking. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning, poor production, and/or poor craft.

* **Unacceptable** Performance and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the motion graphics and general design principles on many levels, and/or a severe lack of interest.

**Attendance**

* Attendance is mandatory and will be taken at the beginning of every class. Since there is so much technical, conceptual, and design information to absorb, regular attendance is essential.
* Unexcused absences will affect your grade. One absence is allowed; after that, your final, overall, numerical grade will drop by 5 percent \(1/2 a grade point \(e.g. A to an A-\)\) for each additional absence.
* Be on Time. Tardiness will affect your grade. For every 15 minutes of tardiness, your final, numerical grade will drop by 0.625 percent
* Contact the professor IN ADVANCE if you will not be in class \(in person or by slack is preferred\).
* ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY DURING THE MIDTERM AND FINAL CRITIQUES.

### ACADEMIC & CREATIVE HONESTY

All  work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA style for citing and documenting source material.

You MUST have complete rights of use to any and all materials which appear in your final  
projects. This includes images, illustrations, audio etc. The source of any materials NOT created by you MUST be documented. Please remember that you can collaborate with the music students for audio tracks, create your own audio or contact the authors of your audio selections for rights. I strongly encourage you to use original images for all of your projects, however should you absolutely require to use stock images/video etc., you will need to provide a PDF of all source files and the usage rights you have purchased/negotiated.
