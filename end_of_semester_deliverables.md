MGS Google Drive:

* A folder labeled your first and last name MGS Spring 2017 (i.e. De Angela Duff MGS Spring 2017)
* within this folder, folders with the following names:
    * 1 demo reel final
    * 2 demo reel draft

Folder Organization:
All projects should be arranged as follows:
The root folder should be the PROJECT NAME. 
Inside your root folder:
AEP (for all AfterEffects projects, please increment your projects as you save!)
SOURCE (for all of your source files, you may organize your own structure within depending on the needs of your project)
(after effects, illustrator, photoshop, etc). Make sure that any type in illustrator has been converted to outlines
DESIGN (for all of your storyboards and style frame comps)
DELIVERABLES (for all final elements submitted for critiques)
lo-res and hi-res versions

Organization of files is key!
I will not require any further specific breakdowns. It will be up to you how to organize your project files efficiently. Do keep in mind that I WILL see your project folders as part of the final deliverables and you will be graded on your professionalism - part of which is your ability to efficiently & neatly organize & maintain your assets. 

Make sure your quicktime files are named as follows:
* YourFirstname_overeffects.mov
* YourFirstname_overeffects2.mov
* YourFirstname_selfportrait.mov or YourFirstname_songintonation.mov
* YourFirstname_selfportrait2.mov or YourFirstname_songintonation2.mov
