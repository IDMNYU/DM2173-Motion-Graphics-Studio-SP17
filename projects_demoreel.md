**Demo Reel** 
As part of your final class presentation, you will be required to polish all 5 of these assignments, and edit them together with audio. The reel will open or close with your end tag, but the internal sequence is up to you. This is how all of your 5 assignments will be presented for final grading. Your audio can be a single music track, a combination of music and sound effects where appropriate.
