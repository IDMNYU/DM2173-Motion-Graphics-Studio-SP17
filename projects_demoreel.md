For your final class presentation during finals week, you will be required to polish 3 of your major projects (self-portrait or song intonation, retro (the midterm), and titles), and edit them together with audio. 
* The reel will open or close with your end tag, but the internal sequence is up to you. * Your audio can be a single music track, or a combination of music and sound effects where appropriate.
