**Song Intonation** up to 10 seconds

Select a song that lends itself to creative visual intonation. Allow the intonation
(Motion Design 041) of the music or a singer’s voice to dictate the kinetics (or motion) and transitions (Motion Design 066-067) of the movement.

Specifications:
• Type must be dominant
• Type can be point, outlined, plane, or hand-drawn (see Motion Design
032-033)
• Support imagery such as lines, shapes, and fragmented letterforms are
encouraged (see Motion Design 038-039)
• NO PHOTOGRAPHY IS ALLOWED

copyrighted or original material you are using.

**Song Intonation Redux**   up to 10 seconds  

You will reiterate a classmates’ song intonation, NOT YOUR OWN, by
exchanging after effects file and assets. You can NOT start completely
from scratch. You must incorporate at least one element from the original
piece. You do not have to use them all however. Think of remixes of music.
Some remixes retain the quality of the original, while others are totally
unrecognizable from the original.
