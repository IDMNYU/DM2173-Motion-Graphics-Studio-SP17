### ASSIGNMENTS: After Effects Diary
 ---

**Post entries of your after effects diary to the MGS slack channel.** 
* a couple of sentences at most about whether it was helpful or not in explaning x (where x is a variable to substitute whatever motion graphics principle you are learning about), better than another tutorial or book at explaining x, etc. It doesn't have to be an entire paragraph.
* Be as specific as possible. Post URLs, titles and authors of online tutorials or books. Often you do not complete the entire course in one sitting so be specific about what section(s) of the course you are referring to.

Your diary should chronicle: 
* what online tutorials you have viewed and completed and/or 
* what chapters within after effects books you have actually read and/or done the exercises from.
