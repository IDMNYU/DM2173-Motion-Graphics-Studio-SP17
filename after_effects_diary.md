### ASSIGNMENTS: After Effects Diary

For at least 10 of our 14 weeks together, post an entry in your after effects diary on the class website. Your diary should chronicle what online tutorials you have viewed and completed and what chapters within after effects books you have actually read and/or done the exercises from. (Be as specific as possible. Post URLs, & titles and authors of books.)
