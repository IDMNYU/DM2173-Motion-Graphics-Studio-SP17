### PROJECT: OVEREFFECTS

---

**Overeffects: Place** 30 seconds	
The purpose of this assignment is to exhaustively explore all of the effects in After Effects. The purpose is NOT to create something beautiful. It should be purposefully ugly and/or cheesy. You can create something beautiful for the second iteration. **Think of it as effects vomit.**

* Shoot digital video or photograph to document a place of your choosing.
* Record the natural sound of the environment, also.
* Edit the footage down to 30 seconds.
* Take the edited footage and “overprocess” it in After Effects.
* Use multiple effects and filters to remove the imagery from its initial recognizability, and take it toward an abstract, emotional realm
* Consider the limitations of using given/effects, the value of combining several effects, and the process of indulging in the program’s capabilities by deliberately overusing effects.
* **Alter the sound using After Effects’ audio effects**

**Overeffects: Place Redux** each video will be 15 seconds	
* Iterate the previous assignment to be deliberate in your effects and transitions. 15 seconds.
* Iterate the previous assignment to have more scenes (changes) and transitions. Experiment with the image, effects, and sound more. 15 seconds.
* The two videos should be opposites. One should be thoughtful and the other wild, crazy, wacky, and experimental.

Make sure your video files are named as follows:
* FirstnameLastname_overeffects_date
* FirstnameLastname_overeffects2_date

All motion graphics assignments should be exported, rendered, and uploaded to http://vimeo.com and google drive as follows:

Vimeo
* The aspect ratio should be 16:9, 29.97
* Post lo-res to vimeo for class: 640x 360
* COMPRESSION TYPE: H264
* Sound 44.1 kHz
* Post with these tags **MGS, IDM, NYU**

**Share your vimeo link in our slack channel right before class.**

I would suggest that you go ahead and also export a high-res version so that you don't have to go back and do this at the end of the semester.

Google Drive
* Export hi-res for deliverables: 1920x1080 or 1280x720
* COMPRESSION TYPE: H264
* Upload hi-res version to google drive folder by end of semester (see [end of semester deliverables](end_of_semester_deliverables.md).)
