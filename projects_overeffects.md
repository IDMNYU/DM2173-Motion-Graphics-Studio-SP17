### PROJECT: OVEREFFECTS

---

**Overeffects: Place** 15 seconds	
The purpose of this assignment is to exhaustively explore all of the effects in After Effects. The purpose is NOT to create something beautiful. It should be purposefully ugly and/or cheesy. You can create something beautiful for the second iteration. **Think of it as effects vomit.**

* Shoot digital video or photograph to document a place of your choosing.
* Record the natural sound of the environment, also.
* Edit the footage down to 30 seconds.
* Take the edited footage and “overprocess” it in After Effects.
* Use multiple effects and filters to remove the imagery from its initial recognizability, and take it toward an abstract, emotional realm
* Consider the limitations of using given/effects, the value of combining several effects, and the process of indulging in the program’s capabilities by deliberately overusing effects.
* Alter the sound using After Effects’ audio effects

**Overeffects: Place Redux** 15 seconds	
* Iterate the previous assignment to use effects purposefully and strategically.
